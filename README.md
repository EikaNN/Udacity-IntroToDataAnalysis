# Intro to Data Analysis

[Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170) is a course offered by Udacity and taught by Caroline Buckey that serves as an introduction to the world of data analysis.

In each Lesson directory there is an ipython notebook with the examples and solutions of the course. To run the notebook with [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/):

```bash
jupyter-notebook <fileName>.ipynb
```

To run the notebook with the same environment as in the course, use [environment.yml](environment.yml) file to create the corresponding environment. For example, with [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/intro.html) package manager:

```bash
conda env --create -f environment.yml
```
